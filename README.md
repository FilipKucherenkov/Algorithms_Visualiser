## Technologies used:
 
 
 
### ReactJS Web app to visualise different Pathfinding algorithms such as A-star, Breadth-First-Search and Dijkstra. 👨‍💻 
#### Functionality includes:
  * Selecting a source and destination nodes. 🔥
  * Choosing as options which algorithms to run and visualise. 🔥
  * Visualisation shows the explored path + the shortest path between source and destination node. Functionality includes traveling through diagonals as well. 🔥
  * The board can be reset at any time using a button. 🔥
  * The Generate maze button uses DFS algorithm to generate a maze on the grid.
